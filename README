OVERVIEW
========

This project is practice using interrupts. The upper 4 LEDs will be a binary
counter triggering off of timer 0 interrupts. The lower 4 LEDs will be matched
to the lower four switches, and this will be the main thread of execution.


COMPILING
=========

To build this project, simply run the Make utility.

$ make


INSTALLING
==========

To install the code to the ATMega32, we once again use Make.

$ make install


HARDWARE
========

Attach PORTA to LCD Ctrl and PORTB to LCD Data.


RUNNING
=======

The program will begin running automatically after running 'make install'. To
restart the program, hit the RESET switch on the development board.


SIZE
====

As part of this assignment, we were asked to determine the size in bytes of
each function used in this project. This data is most easily presented in a
table.

+-------------+------+
| FUNCTION    | SIZE |

OVERVIEW
========

This project's purpose is to set up printf() to output to a LCD display.
To this end, a series of quotations are cycled through and output to the LCD.


COMPILING
=========

To build this project, simply run the Make utility.

$ make


INSTALLING
==========

To install the code to the ATMega32, we once again use Make.

$ make install


HARDWARE
========

Attach PORTA to LCD Ctrl and PORTB to LCD Data.


RUNNING
=======

The program will begin running automatically after running 'make install'. To
restart the program, hit the RESET switch on the development board.


SIZE
====

As part of this assignment, we were asked to determine the size in bytes of
each function used in this project. This data is most easily presented in a
table.
